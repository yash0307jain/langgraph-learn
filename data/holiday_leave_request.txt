**Subject:** Holiday Leave Request

Dear, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request holiday leave for [duration] due to [brief explanation, e.g., personal reasons, family commitments, etc.]. 

I have completed all my tasks and am unable to perform my duties effectively. I believe that taking this time off will help me recharge. I anticipate returning to work on [expected return date].

Please let me know if you need any further information or if I can assist with anything during my absence.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,  
Yash
