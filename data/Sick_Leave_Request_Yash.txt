Subject: Sick Leave Request

Dear Sindhuja,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally request a sick leave for today, as I am not feeling well.

I have ensured that my current projects are on track and will be managed in my absence. I will also be available via email for any urgent matters during my leave. I will ensure a smooth transition and provide any necessary information to my colleagues before my departure.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your understanding and support. 

Best regards,

Yash
