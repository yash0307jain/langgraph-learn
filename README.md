# LangGraph

#### Elements

-   State: The **State** is a shared data structure that holds the current information or contect of the entire applications.
-   Nodes: **Nodes** are individual functions or operations that perform specific taska within the graph.
-   Graph: A **Graph** in LangGraph is the overarching structure that mps out how different taska (nodes) are connected and executed.
-   Edge: **Edges** are the connections between nodes that determine the flow of execution.
-   Conditional Edge: **Conditional Edges** are specialized connections that decide the next node to execute based on specific conditions or logic applied to the current state.
-   START: The **START** node is a virtual entry point in LangGraph, marking where the workflow begins.
-   END: The **END** node signifies the conclusion of the workflow in LangGraph.
-   Tools: **Tools** are specialized functions or utilities that nodes can itilize to perform specific tasks such as fethcing data from an API.
-   ToolNode: A **ToolNode** is just a special kind of node whose main job us to run a tool.
-   StateGraph: A **StateGraph** is a class in LangGraph used to build and compile the graph structure.
-   Runnable: A **Runnable** in LangGraph is a standardized, executable component that performs a specific task within an AI Workflow.

#### Messages

-   Human Message: Represents input from a user
-   System Message: Used to provide instructions or context to the model
-   Function Message: Represents the result of a function call
-   AI Message: Represents responses generated by AI Models
-   Tool Message: Similar to Function Message, but specific to tool usage
